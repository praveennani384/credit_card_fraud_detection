## Machine Learning Model

The `Credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb` script contains the implementation of the machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. It includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Pipeline

The `pipeline.ipynb` script demonstrates the utilization of a machine learning pipeline for credit card fraud detection. It integrates preprocessing steps, such as feature scaling, with a trained Random Forest Classifier model to predict fraudulent transactions.

## Random Sample Generator

The `Random_sample_generator.ipynb` script generates random sample input data and makes predictions using the pre-trained machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. It allows for testing and validation of the model's performance.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide an end-to-end solution for credit card fraud detection, from model development to deployment. By encapsulating preprocessing, model training, and testing steps within scripts, it simplifies the process of building and evaluating fraud detection models.
